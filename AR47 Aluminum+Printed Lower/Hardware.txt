	Optional Operations
		Besides tapping the threads directly into the aluminum plate, you can also utilize press in
		threaded nuts for far stronger threads. Simply drill out the threaded holes with a .1732" drill
		(4.35mm) then press in the nuts with the hex head oriented away from where the bolt head would be.

	Magwell bending jig
		Utilize the flat spots just above the front takedown hole for alighment before bending, and don't
		bend two of the same sides, make sure they are mirrored.

		Shave down all screws to be flush when mounted, follow the step file for the mag catch to be modified.
